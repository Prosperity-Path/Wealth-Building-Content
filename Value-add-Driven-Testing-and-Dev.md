# Value-add Driven Testing and Development

Building good technology takes so much learning, planning, and effort that it’s natural to focus more on building instead of the ‘why’ behind the building. Similarly, the feedback loop from actually building something is immediate relative to thinking and planning. So as a helpful forcing function, many disciplined developers use Test Driven Development to ensure that they’re thinking through the functionality appropriately upfront and then have a guarantee that the functionality behaves as intended throughout the development process. While this approach offers a helpful guarantee from a code functionality prospective, the tests do nothing to ensure that value is being created. 

To ensure that value is being created by functionality, we’ve rallied around a core tenet called Value-add Driven Testing and Development (VaDTaD). Fundamentally, this type of development forces us to answer the question how is the intended functionality applying knowledge to create leverage against a practical goal in a reproducible way. It breaks proposed functionality into pieces that correspond to the minimum set of components required to create value. The following questions represent the components for value creation:

**What’s the practical objective that you’re going to reduce friction against?**

* How are you decreasing the time, money, effort or brain cycles to do something that adds utility to the user? Part of the reason Door Dash is so successful is because they know that eating is a practical objective 2-3 times a day for everyone. There’s quite a bit of inherent friction in preparing a meal, so it’s an easy target.

**What competitive advantage do you have that will reduce friction for a user?**

* While Turbo Tax may not be novel from the software prospective, it produces a lot of value because they wrap the entire information advantage of a team of accountants into an easily navigable interface.

**What triggers the action that reduces friction?**

* Every action ultimately needs to be triggered by something. For DoorDash the trigger is whenever someone gets hungry when they’re around an electronic device, which is incredibly powerful because it happens organically and daily. Turbo Tax plays on a the trigger of someone having to do their taxes, which is powerful because it has to happen, but it only occurs once per year.

**What’s the action [or set of actions] that reduces the friction?**

* There’s no tangible value unless there’s some type of action. In the case of DoorDash, the action is clear-- a restaurant prepares your desired meal and a driver brings it to you. The action clearly reduces the friction of meal prep to a couple digital clicks.

**What’s the compounding effect of reducing friction? How is that shown to the user?**

* This piece isn’t critical in creating value, but it is a value multiplier with a little bit of a forethought, particularly for application dealing with data. With every single trigger, user input, and action, we receive information about the user. If you save all of these data in a thoughtful way, you can provide functionality to the user that let’s them know they’re receiving additional value from continued utilization. For instance, Turbo Tax saves all user inputs over the years and makes relevant recommendations that create a huge time savings for users.

You’ll find that these questions are closely integrated into documentation and the [Product Development Kit](https://github.com/Prosperity-Path/PDK).
